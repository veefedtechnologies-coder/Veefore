## System Architecture

VeeFore features a modern web interface built with React and TypeScript, leveraging Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for a consistent design system. State management is handled with React hooks and context, and Vite is used for optimized builds. The backend is built on Node.js with Express.js, utilizing MongoDB for data storage and Firebase Auth for authentication. SendGrid is integrated for email services, and local file storage with a CDN handles media files. The system supports multi-tenant architecture with workspace-based organization, role-based access control, and a credit system for usage-based billing. AI integration is central, automating content generation, response generation, and social media analytics. The platform includes advanced scheduling, real-time analytics sync, and a rule-based automation engine for various social media interactions.
